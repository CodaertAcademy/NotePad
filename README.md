# NotePad

Building an online notepad with Cloud firestore


Using the tools bootstrap, sass and Cloud Firestore, design a function online notepad. 

Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- The notepad will have an authentication page.
- The home page will consist of the notes already written by the user.
- The user can either create a new note, update a previously written note and delete a note he doesn't need anymore
- Lastly, he can share any note of his with someone else. Shared notes will also be displayed on the user's (who the note has been shared with) home page


Hint
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- Google Keep is a good example of what this project is about.
- You are free to either make this a one-page webapp or a multiple page webapp


Rules
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- You are free to use any assisting plugin to build this, but you are not allowed to use any framework (angular, react, vue etc).
- All you code pages will be committed to this repo...but you are free to fork this repo in your own github account.
